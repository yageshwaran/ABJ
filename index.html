  <h3>Early Life and Education</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._P._J._Abdul_Kalam">Abdul Kalam</a> was born on 15 October 1931, to a Tamil Muslim family in the pilgrimage centre of Rameswaram on Pamban Island, then in the Madras Presidency
      and now in the State of Tamil Nadu. His father Jainulabdeen
      Marakayar
      was a boat owner and imam of a local mosque; his mother Ashiamma was a housewife.
    </li>
    <ol type="I">
      <li>His father owned a ferry that took Hindu pilgrims back and forth between Rameswaram and the now uninhabited Dhanushkodi.</li>
      <li>Kalam was the youngest of four brothers and one sister in his family.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>His ancestors had been wealthy Marakayar traders and landowners, with numerous properties and large tracts of land. Even though his ancestors had been wealthy Marakayar traders, the family had lost most of its fortunes by the 1920s and was
      poverty-stricken by the time Kalam was born.</li>
